* Graphical interfaces  
TODO: same as above

This project was started as an academic research in my university and still slooowly is beign developed and maintained.  
It icludes my thesis and presentation together with all the code.  
Originally based on [the work by Jaime Rangel-Mondrag√≥n](http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/892/), updated and improved.
Currently the interfaces and code comments are in ukrainian.


Feel free to contact/collaborate-with me if you are interested in the theory of formal languages.

Regards,
Dahn.
